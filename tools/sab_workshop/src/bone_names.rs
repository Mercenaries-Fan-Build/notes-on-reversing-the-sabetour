//! Bone name-hash → name, for rigs read straight out of the game.
//!
//! A MESH stores only `pandemic_hash(boneName)`, never the string, so a rig loaded from a megapack
//! can only call its bones `bone_XXXXXXXX`. The `.skel` files in `output/` had real names because
//! `sab_skeleton` resolved them through a recovered dictionary — that dictionary is the only thing
//! those files carried that the pack does not, so it lives here now and the in-app path gets the
//! same names. COPIED from `tools/sab_skeleton/src/main.rs` (`known_bone_names` / `build_name_map`);
//! the misses are documented there and kept verbatim rather than re-guessed.
//!
//! Anything not in the dictionary keeps its hash form: the hash IS the identity the animation system
//! keys on, so `bone_XXXXXXXX` is a complete name, not a placeholder for a missing one.
